        Zebotan, originated in 2001, is a leading brand for Womens' wear in Nashik, India designing Indian ethnic wear ranging from bridal fashion couture to traditional Indian wear and trendy collection. Our bridal wear collection includes wedding lehengas, designer sarees, designer salwar suits and exclusive chaniya cholis. Our trendy collection includes fabulous designer kurtis whereas our traditional collection includes punjabi suits, beautiful chudidars and designer dress materials.
From the onset we made it our mission to offer our clients unsurpassed quality garments at competitive prices. We have uncompromisingly kept in step not only with the changing trends of Indian fashion but also with the attitude of the urban Indian woman. The result is that today we are the foremost brand choice for ladies apparels in Nashik. Using graceful and durable fabrics, we have transformed traditional Indian attire into trendy contemporary wear.
Our success can be attributed to the remarkable synergy of people, processes and innovation that enabled Zebotan to overhaul and set fresh standards in the current fashion scenario. 
In the world of Zebotan, the strife for innovation is always important to us. In less than a decade we achieved recognition as one of the leading brands in Indian fashion wear. The beauty of our products has won the hearts of people living in India and abroad. Every year our collection is replenished with new colours and designs, but the essential characteristics remain the same - exceptional quality, innovative design and immaculate craftmanship. Over the years, we have acquired significant equity, not just in terms of financial success, but also in terms of customer perception.
